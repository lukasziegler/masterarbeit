	        <h3>Research at LMU Munich</h3>
			In the Group for Media Informatics at the University of Munich Prof. Dr. Florian Alt studies how people can be enticed to interact in public spaces, and how novel interaction techniques can be created for open pervasive displays. His research interest is at the crossroads of ubiquitous computing and HCI. Find out more on <a href="http://www.florian-alt.org/academic/">florian-alt.org</a>.

	        <h3>PDSurvey Plattform</h3>
	        With this installation at the LMU Munich (Oettingenstra&szlig;e 67) we aim to simplify the conception, execution and evaluation of questionnaires. Our goal is to create a research plattform allowing  display providers and fellow researchers to execute surveys on their public display networks. Here you see the frontend of the survey plattform, developed by Lukas Ziegler as part of his Master's thesis.
