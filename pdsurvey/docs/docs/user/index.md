# User Documentation

All of the infos for the front-end user

"Most likely others will use your program. Writing a good user's manual will facilitate the use of your program. The important thing is to write for the naive user. It is best to assume that users of your program will know nothing about computers or their interfaces. A clear, concise, step-by-step description of how one uses your program can be of great value not only to others, but to you as well. You can identify awkward or misleading commands, and by correcting these, develop a much more usable product. Start from your requirements document to remind yourself what your program does."
