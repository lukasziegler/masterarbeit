	A shorter way, inspired by MyPosition \cite{valkanova2014myposition}:

	\begin{enumerate}
	\item We \textbf{present} the design and development process of \textit{PDSurvey}, an interactive survey platform for public displays. Additionally we propose a taxanomy of standardized questionnaires, usable for public display evaluation.

	\item PDSurvey aims to facilitate the conduction of surveys on public displays...
	\item We \textbf{evaluated} PDSurvey regarding two first research questions, <feedback channel, (question type), motivation for approaching>.

	\item We \textbf{found} that most users prefer to complete survey directly on-site.
	\end{enumerate}
