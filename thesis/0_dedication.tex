I would like to thank Jiamin Shi, Axel H{\"o}sl, Dr. Julie Wagner, and the entire Mediainformatics chair, for their great spirit and support. It was great to be able to complete my Master studies and thesis at the chair. Additionally, I would like to thank my parents for their continuous support throughout my entire education. Much would not have been possible without their love and support. But above all, the thanks goes to Prof. Dr. Florian Alt, for his guidance, feedback, support and the time devoted to my Master's thesis.
