\section*{Acknowledgments}

First, I would like to thank Prof. Dr. Florian Alt, for his guidance, feedback, and the time devoted to my Master's thesis. Additionally, I would like to thank Jiamin Shi, Axel H{\"o}sl, Dr. Julie Wagner, and the entire Mediainformatics chair, for their great spirit and support. But above all, I would like to thank my parents for their continuous support throughout my entire education. Much would not have been possible without their love and care.
