\section*{Dedication}


I would like to thank Jiamin Shi, Axel H{\"o}sl and Dr. Julie Wagner and the entire Mediainformatics chair, for their great spirit and support. It was an honor to be able to complete my Master studies and thesis at the chair. Additionally I would like to thank my parents how they have supported me, not just throughout the last five years, but especially during my studies. Much would not have been possible without their love and support. 

But above all the thanks goes to Prof. Dr. Florian Alt, for his guidance, feedback, support and the time devoted to my Master thesis.
