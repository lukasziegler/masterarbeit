\subsection{Conducting Surveys}

	\begin{itemize}[itemsep=0pt] 
	\item state how complex it is to administer / execute / conduct a survey or questionnaire
	\item encourage the motivation for creating a plattform like this!
	\item differentiate between surveys and questionnaires. survey = Umfrage, questionnaire = Fragebogen

	and clarify what the difference is between the already existing approaches to my approach.





% In the last part, restate that our approach is new, and that we are not aware of any similar approach before. 
What is unique about our approach: That we will have the opportunity to conduct surveys across a broad number of devices (large displays, tablets, smartphones, desktops), since they all access the same platform via a RESTful API. Which allows the greatest possible coverage of display providers' public displays and end consumer devices.

\subsection{Temp}

	The goal while reading papers for literature review was to find out how others evaluate public displays. The aim was to identify important aspects of public display deployments - both from a researcher's as well form a practitioner's perspective. Furthermore it was of interest to develop an understanding of how these aspects could be addressed through surveys. The

	\item Paper 25: \textit{Worlds of Information: Designing for Engagement at a Public Multi-touch Display (von Jacucci)} liefert einen erstklassigen Ueberblick ueber die Evaluationsmethoden
	\item Paper 106: \textit{MirrorTouch: Combining Touch and Mid-air Gestures for Public Displays} (von Joerg Mueller) liefert den Stand von 2014

	\item papers 23, 25: Best-practices / guidelines for designing good public display applications

	\item discrepancy between field and lab study: \cite{Ojala2011}.

	\item : Social behaviors arising from public display usage: crowding, massively parallel interaction, teamwork, games, negotiations of transitions and handovers, conflict management, gestures and overt remarks to co-present people, marking the display for others. \cite{peltonen2008s}

	\item \cite{redhead2009designing}: ``the display should clearly conved low commitment interaction, that it is quick and enjoyable. People preferred to interact with the display as objects, rather than via text based navigation.'' (find source, not sure whether I paraphrased it or if it's a citation)
