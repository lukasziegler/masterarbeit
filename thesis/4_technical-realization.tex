\section{Technical Realization}

In this chapter we will deal with the infrastructure and technical implementation of the public display survey platform. First off we will start with the requirements for the survey platform (section \ref{4a_requirements}). Subsequently the architecture for the platform will be our main focus (section \ref{4b_architecture}). To facilitate the training period for successors we will also take a look at the software model (section \ref{4c_modeling}) and the implementation (section \ref{4d_implementation}). For more specific information regarding maintenance or for other students extending this project, please refer to the Documentation in the Appendix.

In figure \ref{fig:4-pdsurvey-platform} a brief overview of the \textit{PDSurvey} platform and its components is given. The platform consists of three major parts: a backend for display providers (PDAdmin), a RESTful server (PDServer) and the user interface itself, being embeded on the end user devices (public displays, tablets, smartphones or other devices). Should a component not support HTML and JavaScript execution, then the required surveys can still be communicated directly with the REST API of PDServer.

 For administrative purposes we created a RESTful backend (PDBackend), 


which enables the creation, management and distribution of surveys to public displays. Attached to this backend there is the   a responsive client 

backend for administrators (built with Angular.js and Bootstrap) and a simplified version of 


\subsection{Requirements}
\label{4a_requirements}

%%% REQUIREMENTS of PROPOSAL %%%
Analyzing the problem statement and scope of the thesis, the following requirements can be derived:

\begin{enumerate}[itemsep=0pt] 
\item development of a survey tool that allows interactive public display installations to be comprehensively assessed 
\item a web-based survey platform will be implemented that can easily be used to evaluate and compare public displays through different channels 
\item different channels to support: 1) evaluation directly at
the display or 2) through a (mobile) website that allows participation also via a smartphone
or tablet.
\item configuration options for public display owners
\end{enumerate}


%%% TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS %%%
Requirements derived from the problem statement and scope of the thesis:

\begin{enumerate}
\item JavaScript embed code, for public displays
\item supporting multiple devices: public displays, mobile (smartphone, tablet), desktop
\item responsive web design
\end{enumerate}

Additional requirements, self proposed:
\begin{enumerate}
\item scalable
\item modular / extensible
\item multilingual / internationalization (i18n)
\end{enumerate}
