\subsubsection{Package Manager}

\begin{enumerate}
\item NPM and Bower (instead of Browserify) + state reasons
\item State reasons, why I did / didn't check in the code for npm / bower components: \url{http://addyosmani.com/blog/checking-in-front-end-dependencies/}

    \begin{itemize}
    \item "prevent bad dependencies from breaking their app"
    \item "the longevity of package managers and their tooling"
    \item to be independent of other services and thus to garantee a longer life for the tool
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

give an overview of current Frontend Frameworks and briefly state which one I used why. A good comparision can be found here \url{http://www.sitepoint.com/5-most-popular-frontend-frameworks-compared/}

\item Bootstrap
\item Foundation by Zurb
\item ...
\end{enumerate}
