\section{Expert Interview}
\label{sec:expert-interview}

OPTIONAL

To connect to the rationale of the field study from the previous section, we also conducted two interviews with industry experts. It was of interest to us to get feedback on how our thoughts regarding the conception of the PDSurvey platform hold true. To see whether PDSurvey helps display providers conduct and deploy surveys on public displays, or if there are still certain drawbacks.

In order to see whether our thoughts regarding the survey platform itself hold true in practice, we alao chose to conduct an expert interview with a display provider and communication scientist, who are both experts in their area and are able to assess the requirements for public display deployments and for the conduction of questionnaires.
