\subsection{Discussion}

Start with a few sentences that summarize the most important results (+ see \url{http://www.ldeo.columbia.edu/~martins/sen_sem/thesis_org.html}).

Now allowing room for interpretation and personal opinions

\subsection{Limitations}

\begin{enumerate}
\item the tablet was always on, it was possible to approach the tablet directly without having the option to participate in the survey via smartphone or email. 
\item the novelty effect played a role for the first part of the evaluation. It was striking to see a response rate of 50 percent. If we exclude all participants who directly accessed the tablet and skipped the appeal to use one of the four options, there was still a response rate of 10 percent.
\end{enumerate}
